    "\n",
    "python is a popular programming language for saveral reasons.here are some key features that makes python a preferred choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1*Readability*: Python emphasizes readability and uses simple and clean syntax,making it easier to understand and write code.This feature is particularly beneficial for beginners and experienced programmer alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "2*Versatility*: Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications,ncluding web development,data analysis,artificial intelligence,scientific computing,automation,and more.Its flexibilty allows developers to work on diverse projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3*Platform independece*: Python is a platform-independent language,which means that code written in Python can run on various operating systems without modification.This cross-platfrom compatibility makes Python an aatractive choice for developers working in different environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspects that makes Python a popular choice for programming is its strong support or object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.Pyhthon allows developers to create reusable and organized code through classes and objects,promoting modularity and code resuability.This OOP support simplifies complex problems by breaking them down into smaller,more manageable components,enhancing code structure and maintainability.\n",

    "## QUES 5) Explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, type casting refers to the conversion of one data type to another. This process allows you to change the data type of a variable or value. Here's an explanation of type casting with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Implicit Type Conversion*:\n",
    "   - Python automatically converts data types in certain situations, such as when performing operations between different types.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   python\n",
    "   num_int = 10\n",
    "   num_float = 5.5\n",
    "   result = num_int + num_float  # Python implicitly converts num_int to a float before performing the addition\n",
    "   print(result)  # Output: 15.5\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Explicit Type Conversion*:\n",
    "   - You can explicitly convert data types using predefined functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   python\n",
    "   num_str = \"50\"\n",
    "   num_int = int(num_str)  # Convert the string \"50\" to an integer\n",
    "   print(num_int)  # Output: 50\n",
    "\n",
    "   num_float = float(num_int)  # Convert the integer 50 to a float\n",
    "   print(num_float)  # Output: 50.0\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Type Casting between Different Data Types*:\n",
    "   - You can convert data types between integers, floats, and strings.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   python\n",
    "   num_int = 100\n",
    "   num_str = str(num_int)  # Convert the integer 100 to a string\n",
    "   print(num_str)  # Output: \"100\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   num_float = float(num_str)  # Convert the string \"100\" to a float\n",
    "   print(num_float)  # Output: 100.0\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Handling Errors during Type Casting*:\n",
    "   - Type casting can raise errors if the conversion is not possible (e.g., converting a string that is not a number to an integer).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   python\n",
    "   num_str = \"hello\"\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       num_int = int(num_str)  # Trying to convert a non-numeric string to an integer will raise a ValueError\n",
    "   except ValueError as e:\n",
    "       print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "Type casting is a useful technique in Python to manipulate data types and perform operations that require values of different types. If you have more questions or need further examples"

    "## QUES 6) How do conditional statements work in Python? Illustrate with examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey there! Conditional statements in Python allow you to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions. The most common conditional statements in Python are if, elif (short for else if), and else.\n",

    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Example 1: Using if statement\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, if the condition x > 5 is true, the message \"x is greater than 5\" will be printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at an example with if, elif, and else statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Example 2: Using if, elif, and else statements\n",
    "\n",
    "y = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "if y < 10:\n",

    "  \n",
    "  elif y == 10:\n",
    "   \n",
    "  print(\"y is equal to 10\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"y is greater than 10\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, if y is less than 10, it will print \"y is less than 10\". If y is exactly 10, it will print \"y is equal to 10\". If neither of these conditions is met, it will print \"y is greater than 10\".\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the for loop iterates over each element in the fruits list and prints each fruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *While Loop*:\n",
    "   - Use a while loop when you want to iterate based on a condition that needs to be true.\n",
    "   - Here's an example of a while loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example of a while loop\n",
